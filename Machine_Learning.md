I made this device that sends out a notification when there are people or bears in our driveway.  There are existing devices on the market, but they are expensive and usually require a monthly subscription fee.  I researched online and put together a camera which sends a video feed to an opensource motion and object recognition system. It runs a machine learning algorithm called a convolutional neural network to recognize people and bears. Once it  recognizes a defined object, it will send a notification to family members’ cell phones. Please see the animated gif for example.
