# About Me

Hey there! I’m **Tyler K**!  I have always loved building and creating things, whether its solving problems, designing projects, or figuring out how things work.
This curiousity and hands-on approach have inspired me to pursue engineering, where I can combine creativity, technical skills, and problem-solving to develop real world solutions that make a difference.
