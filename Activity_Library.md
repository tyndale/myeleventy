After my grandfather passed away, I wanted to help other teens build meaningful connections with their grandparents.

I applied for and received a $500 Youth Connections grant to create an intergenerational activity library. I researched and purchased activities designed to encourage shared experiences and conversation.

Using my coding skills, I built a live borrowing system (< https://hangingoutwithgramps.kimhousehold.ca >) that tracks activity availability in real time. I shared the platform within a neighbourhood WhatsApp group and continue to expand the library.

This project has been especially meaningful, as it combines technology with human connection.
