I have been volunteering with Burnaby Neighbourhood House since 2021, and one significant role I took on was as a Youth Researcher for Project Sidewalk.

Spending time with my grandparents, I saw how uneven sidewalks and steep curbs could quietly reduce independence for seniors and people with disabilities.
Motivated by this, I eagerly joined the project. After receiving training, I used specialized software and machine learning tools to help map and identify unsafe sidewalks in Burnaby.
I carefully documented missing curb ramps and accessibility hazards, understanding how small details can have a large impact on mobility and quality of life. I was proud to contribute to a project that helps create safer, more inclusive communities.
